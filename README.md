# NUREU17

Repository to host work from Northwestern University REU students in the summer of 2017.

Project description:

We are doing variable stars research, motivated by the upcoming LSST survey - a 10 year survey of the night sky that will find a huge number of eclipsing binaries and other variable stars. For this project, we are developing software to classify what we see (the variable stars), and we are creating a citizen science project on zooniverse to help!
