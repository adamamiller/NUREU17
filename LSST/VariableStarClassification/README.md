This is no longer an empty README, but it probably still needs editing.

Repository for Variable Star Classification. Tanner Leighton and Nick Easton are the students working on this project. The main goal of this project is to generate a set of plots which Citizen Scientists on Zooniverse will be able to use for the classification of variable stars. Going forward, once a large sample of stars are classified, a machine learning algorithm can be trained in order to handle the massive data generated by the upcoming LSST.
