Directory for Variable Star Classification, 'VSC'. Tanner Leighton and Nick Easton are the students assigned to work on this project. The initial goal is to create various plots which Citizen Scientists on Zooniverse would be able to use to classify their sources. Once a sufficiently large sample has been classified, a machine learning algorithm would take over. This would allow for easier classification of the massive amount of data coming out of the upcoming LSST.
