We are doing variable stars research, motivated by the upcoming LSST surveyâ€”a 10-year survey of the night sky that will find a huge number of eclipsing binaries and other variable stars. For this project, we are developing software to classify the variable stars, and we are creating a citizen science project on zooniverse to help!
