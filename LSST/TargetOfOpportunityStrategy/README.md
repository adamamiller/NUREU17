## Target of Opportunity Strategy
Project done by Kristopher Mortensen


### Goal

The goal for the Target of Opportunity Strategy is to create a program that the LSST may use to detect kilonovas, merging NS-NS or NS-BH compact binaries, within expected areas of GW sources produced by LIGO. Given that LSST works from the UV spectrum to near IR, the program should be optimized to not only detect these kilonovas as quickly as possible, but it should search for kilonovas within all of the spectrum. While some papers have argued that either UV, optical, or near IR are the optimal spectrums to find kilonovas, there has not been distinct proof that one spectrum works better to detect these compact binaries. Therefore, we will have to try to work the entire spectrum of LSST that way we will have to optimal chance to detect these kilonovas.

### Basic Background: Kilonovas

Kilonovas are compact binary mergers between either two neutron stars (NS-NS) or a neutron star and a black hole (NS-BH). When they merge they release large amounts of hot mass and energy in the form of eletromagnetic (EM) radiation. In additon, these mergers also are sources of gravitation waves due to the object having massive densities. The EM radiation given off by the kilonovas act as though they behave as transient stars like that of supernovas: short, bright burst in the beginning of the merger then slowly the light dimishes until it is too dark to detect anymore.
