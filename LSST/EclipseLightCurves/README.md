# README

This is an empty README that needs to be edited. 

Currently using ellc DoublePartial to try to write a workable means of running multiple data sets at once so the system returns multiple plots.

Eventually, ellc's detached binary system light curve generation will be coupled with a full Milky Way simulation to provide a reasonable estimate for the eclipsing binary yield that LSST will observe and identify over its run. The simulation should also indicate which varieties of eclipsing binary have the highest yield and which varieties will largely go undetected.
